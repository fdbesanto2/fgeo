## Overview

The __fgeo__ package is a collection of R packages curated by
[ForestGEO](http://www.forestgeo.si.edu/). __fgeo__ installs and loads
multiple R packages in a single step. Each individual package is a
self-contained module that provides tools for a particular type of analyses.
The modular structure of __fgeo__ makes it easy to maintain and expand
ForestGEO's software. Together, all packages in __fgeo__ provide a wide renge
of tools to analyse forest dynamics.  Learn more about the __fgeo__ package at
<http://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo>.

## Installation

```
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("forestgeo/fgeo")
```

## Usage

`library(fgeo)` will load the core __fgeo__ packages: 

* [__bciex__](https://forestgeo.github.io/bciex/), to access data for examples.
* [__try__](https://forestgeo.github.io/try/), to experiment with "beta" code.
* ...


You also get a condensed summary of conflicts with other packages you have loaded:

```{r example}
library(fgeo)
```

You can see conflicts created later with `fgeo_conflicts()`:

```{r conflicts}
fgeo_conflicts()
```

## Packages

As well as the core packages, installing __fgeo__ also installs a selection of other packages that you're likely to use frequently, but probably not in every analysis. This includes packages for:

*   Analyse soil data:

    * [__soilkrig__](https://forestgeo.github.io/soilkrig/), to krig soil data
      as per John et al. (2007).
    * ...

*   Topic 2:
