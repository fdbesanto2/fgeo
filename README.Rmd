[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/forestgeo/fgeo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/forestgeo/fgeo)

### Overview

THIS IS A DEMO.

The __fgeo__ package is a collection of R packages curated by
[ForestGEO](http://www.forestgeo.si.edu/). __fgeo__ installs and loads
multiple R packages in a single step. Each individual package is a
self-contained module that provides tools for a particular type of analyses.
The modular structure of __fgeo__ makes it easy to maintain and expand
ForestGEO's software. Together, all packages in __fgeo__ provide a wide renge
of tools to analyse forest dynamics.  Learn more about the __fgeo__ package at
<http://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo>.

### Installation

```
# To install from a private repo, use auth_token with a token
# from https://github.com/settings/tokens. You only need the
# repo scope. Best practice is to save your PAT in env var called
# GITHUB_PAT.
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("forestgeo/fgeo", auth_token = "abc")
```

### Usage

`library(fgeo)` will load the core __fgeo__ packages. If __fgeo__ conflicts with other packages you have loaded, you'll get summary.

```{r example}
library(fgeo)
```

You can see conflicts created later with `fgeo_conflicts()`.

```{r conflicts}
fgeo_conflicts()
```

### Packages

As well as the core packages, installing __fgeo__ also installs a selection of other packages that you're likely to use frequently, but probably not in every analysis.
