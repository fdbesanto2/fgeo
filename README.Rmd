__fgeo__ installs and loads multiple R packages, functions and datasets to analyze trees' abundance, demography, and habitats (`r link_core(analyze)`). It also includes general-purpose functions to simplify the visualization (`r link_core(visualize)`) and manipulation (`r link_core(manipulate)`) of ForestGEO datasets (e.g. `r link_core(datasets)`).

## Installation

Install __fgeo__ from GitHub with:

```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("forestgeo/fgeo")
```

## Example

Load all __fgeo__ packages in one step.

```{r example}
library(fgeo)
```

Help about everything.

```R
fgeo_help()
```

Help about something.

```R
fgeo_help("datasets")
```

```{r}
# Short name
stem <- luquillo_stem_1ha
# This dataset comes with multiple censuses.
unique(stem$CensusID)
stem
```

Do something useful.

Pick the data you want.

```{r}
# Pick one census from the bottom (n < 0) rank of CensusID. See ?pick_top().
stem6 <- pick_top(stem, var = CensusID, n = -1)
unique(stem6$CensusID)
```

Determine the status of each tree based on the status of each stem.

```{r}
stem6 <- add_status_tree(stem6, status_a = "A", status_d = "D")
alive_trees <- subset(stem6, status_tree == "A")

# Note that alive trees may have some missing, gone or dead stems
some_cols <- c( "treeID", "status_tree", "stemID", "status")
example_tree <- 46
subset(alive_trees, treeID == example_tree, some_cols)
```

Pick stems of 10 mm or more.

```{r}
ten_plus <- pick_dbh_min(alive_trees, 10)
range(ten_plus$dbh, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Drop missing values of `dbh` with an informative warning.

```{r}
non_missing <- drop_if_na(ten_plus, "dbh")
```

Count distinct values of `stemID` and `treeID`.

```{r}
count_distinct_stemid(non_missing)

# Collapse treeID by picking the stem with largest dbh
largest_stem <- fgeo.tool::pick_largest_hom_dbh(non_missing)

count_distinct_stemid(largest_stem)
```

Count largest stems (unique `treeID`s) by species.

```{r}
by_sp <- group_by(largest_stem, sp)
count_distinct_treeid(by_sp)
```
