__fgeo__ installs and loads multiple R packages, functions, and datasets to analyze trees abundance, demography, and habitats (`r link_core(analyze)`). It also includes general-purpose functions to simplify the visualization (`r link_core(visualize)`) and manipulation (`r link_core(manipulate)`) of ForestGEO datasets (e.g. `r link_core(datasets)`).

## Before you install __fgeo__

Before you install __fgeo__, you may try it at https://bit.ly/fgeo-demo (you will need to create a free rstudio.cloud account).

## Installation

* Try this if you have installed packages from GitHub before.

```R
# install.packages(devtools)
devtools::install_github("forestgeo/fgeo")
```

* Try [installing fgeo from its source code](https://github.com/forestgeo/fgeo-build#install-fgeo) if you exceeded GitHub's rate-limit (to increase your rate-limit follow the link in the next point).

* Read the [detailed instructions](https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo/articles/siteonly/questions-and-answers.html#how-can-i-troubleshoot-the-installation-from-github) if you need more help. For more details on how to install packages from GitHub, see [this article](https://goo.gl/dQKEeg). 

You can remove __fgeo__ with `remove.packages("fgeo")`.

## Example

Load all __fgeo__ packages in one step.

```{r example}
library(fgeo)
```

Need help? Use `fgeo_help()` to search every help file in the __fgeo__ package.

```R
fgeo_help()
```

You can narrow down your search by using a keyword.

```R
fgeo_help("datasets")
```

```{r}
# Short name
stem6 <- download_data("luquillo_stem6_random")
stem6
```

Determine the status of each tree based on the status of each stem.

```{r}
stem6 <- add_status_tree(stem6, status_a = "A", status_d = "D")
alive_trees <- subset(stem6, status_tree == "A")
alive_trees
```

Pick stems of 10 mm or more.

```{r}
ten_plus <- pick_dbh_min(alive_trees, 10)
range(ten_plus$dbh, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Count distinct values of `stemID` and `treeID`.

```{r}
# Drop missing values of `dbh`
non_missing <- filter(ten_plus, !is.na(dbh))

# Stem abundance
abundance(non_missing)

# Tree abundance (picking main stems -- with highest `hom` and largest `dbh`)
largest_stem <- fgeo.tool::pick_main_stem(non_missing)
abundance(largest_stem)
```

Count largest stems (unique `treeID`s) by species.

```{r}
by_sp <- group_by(largest_stem, sp)
abundance(by_sp)
```
