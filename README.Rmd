## Installation

To install __fgeo__ run this code in R:

```
if (!requireNamespace("fgeo")) {
  if (!requireNamespace("remotes")) {
    install.packages("remotes")
  }
  remotes::install_github("forestgeo/fgeo")
}
```

## Example

Load all __fgeo__ packages in one step.

```{r example}
library(fgeo)
```

Find everything.

```R
fgeo_help()
```

Find something.

```R
fgeo_help("map")
```

Datasets.

```{r}
fgeo_data <- fgeo_index_datasets()
subset(fgeo_data, grepl("luquillo", dataset))

# Short name
stem <- luquillo_stem_1ha
stem
```

Do something useful.

Pick the data you want.

```{r}
# This dataset comes with multiple censuses.
unique(stem$CensusID)

# Pick one census from the bottom (n < 0) rank of CensusID. See ?pick_top().
stem6 <- pick_top(stem, var = CensusID, n = -1)
unique(stem6$CensusID)
```

Determine the status of each tree based on the status of each stem.

```{r}
stem6 <- add_status_tree(stem6, status_a = "A", status_d = "D")
alive_trees <- subset(stem6, status_tree == "A")

# Note that alive trees may have some missing, gone or dead stems
some_cols <- c( "treeID", "status_tree", "stemID", "status")
example_tree <- 46
subset(alive_trees, treeID == example_tree, some_cols)
```

Pick stems of 10 mm or more.

```{r}
ten_plus <- pick_dbh_min(alive_trees, 10)
range(ten_plus$dbh, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Drop missing values of `dbh` with an informative warning.

```{r}
non_missing <- drop_if_na(ten_plus, "dbh")
```

Calculate abundance of stems and trees.

```{r}
abundance_stem(non_missing)

abundance_tree(non_missing)
```

Abundance by species.

```{r}
by_sp <- group_by(non_missing, sp)

abundance_stem(by_sp)

n_trees <- abundance_tree(by_sp)
n_trees
```

Which are the three most abundant tree species?

```{r}
top3 <- pick_top(n_trees, n, -3)
top3
```
