# fgeo: Analyze forest diversity and dynamics <img src="https://i.imgur.com/39pvr4n.png" align="right" height=44 />

[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/forestgeo/fgeo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/forestgeo/fgeo)

[![lifecycle](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/#experimental)

(The developmental stage of this package is according to [this website](https://www.tidyverse.org/lifecycle/).)



__fgeo__ installs and loads multiple R packages of [ForestGEO](http://www.forestgeo.si.edu/) in a single step. Together, all packages of __fgeo__ provide a wide range of tools to analyse forest diversity and dynamics. To learn more about the structure of ForestgGEO's software see [this article](https://goo.gl/c5X6qk).

[Packages index](https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo/reference/index.html).

## Installation

To install __fgeo__ run the following code in R:

```
missing_remotes <- !require(remotes)
if (missing_remotes) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}

remotes::install_github("forestgeo/fgeo")
```

To learn the details about how to install packages from GitHub, read [this blog post](https://goo.gl/dQKEeg).

## Usage

Load the core __fgeo__ packages in one step.

```{r example}
library(fgeo)
```

Run this to update __fgeo__. This will re-install only the packages that have changed since the last installation -- so it will take a fraction of what it took the first time you installed __fgeo__.

```
fgeo_update()
```

For a detailed description of each function in each package go to the corresponding package's website via the [Packages](https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo/reference/index.html) tab of __fgeo__'s [Home](https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo/index.html) page. 

You can get an overview of all functions exported by each package (including some reexported from other packages) with `fgeo_functions()` -- which can also be helpful if you want to find a function based on some keywords.

```{r functions}
library(dplyr)

all_functions <- fgeo_functions()

matching_pattern <- grepl(pattern = "row", all_functions$fun)
filter(all_functions, matching_pattern)
```
```{r}
all_functions
```
