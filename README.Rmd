## [Quick search](https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo/articles/fgeo.html#quick-search)

## Installation

To install __fgeo__ run this code in R:

```
if (!requireNamespace("fgeo")) {
  if (!requireNamespace("remotes")) {
    install.packages("remotes")
  }
  remotes::install_github("forestgeo/fgeo")
}
```

## Example

[Skip and get started](https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo/articles/fgeo.html#get-started)

[Try __fgeo__ on rstudio.cloud](http://bit.ly/fgeo-demo)

Load all __fgeo__ packages in one step.

```{r example}
library(fgeo)
```

Try the examples.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
census <- fgeo.tool::pick_top(bciex::bci12s7mini, sp, 2)
elevation <- bciex::bci_elevation

map_sp_elev(census)
map_sp_elev(census, elevation)
```

Same (because __fgeo__ already loaded __fgeo.tool__ and __bciex__ for you):

```{r maps, eval=FALSE}
census <- pick_top(bci12s7mini, sp, 2)
elevation <- bci_elevation

map_sp_elev(census)
map_sp_elev(census, elevation)
```
