__fgeo__ installs and loads multiple R packages, functions, and datasets to analyze trees abundance, demography, and habitats (`r link_core(analyze)`). It also includes general-purpose functions to simplify the visualization (`r link_core(visualize)`) and manipulation (`r link_core(manipulate)`) of ForestGEO datasets (e.g. `r link_core(datasets)`).

## Installation

### Before you install __fgeo__

Before you install __fgeo__ you may try it at https://bit.ly/fgeo-demo (you will need to create a free rstudio.cloud account).

### Can you skip the detailed installation?

Skip this section if you understand this code and it works for you. Otherwise keep reading.

```R
# install.packages(devtools)
devtools::install_github("forestgeo/fgeo")
```

### Detailed installation

__fgeo__ will fail to install unless you have the right R environment. These next steps will ensure you have everything you need. Feel free to [ask me for hlep](https://github.com/forestgeo/fgeo/issues/new).

#### 1. Update R, RStudio, and R packages

* [How?](https://fgeo.netlify.com/2018/02/08/2018-02-08-update-r-rstudio-and-r-packages/)
* [why?](https://fgeo.netlify.com/2018/03/06/2018-03-06-should-i-update-all-my-r-packages-frequently-yes-no-why/)

#### 2. Instruct RStudio not to preserve your workspace between sesisons

* [How? and Why?](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html#what-is-real)

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/QqPyHJu.png" align="center" height=450/>

#### 3. Create a new RStudio project (or use the package here)

* [How?](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html#rstudio-projects)
* [Why?](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/)

#### 4. Close any other R session
#### 5. Install the package __devtools__

In R run:

```R
install.packages("devtools")
```

#### 6. Install package development utilities for your platform

* [How?](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486498-Package-Development-Prerequisites)

#### 7. Create an account on https://github.com/

#### 8. Generate a GitHub token named exactly `GITHUB_PAT`

In R run:

```R
usethis::browse_github_pat()
```

* You will be sent to GitHub and you should see something like this:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/huJ6l7n.png" align="center" height=300/>

...

* Make sure your token description says exactly `GITHUB_PAT` and click _Generate token_

...

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/iXWITVV.png" align="center" height=100/>

#### 9. Store your new token in the envitonmental variable `GITHUB_PAT`

In R run:

```R
usethis::edit_r_environ()
```

* A file called .Renviron will open. Type the name and value of your GitHub token. __Ensure to end this file with a new empty line__. Your .Renviron file should now look like this:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/QSEuzbF.png" align="center" height=100/>

...

* Save and close  .Renviron.

#### 10. Press Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + F10 to restart RStudio

#### 11. Install from GitHub the package __fgeo__

In R run this:

```
devtools::install_github("forestgeo/fgeo")
```

For more details on how to install packages from GitHub, see [this article](https://goo.gl/dQKEeg). 

You can remove __fgeo__ with `remove.packages("fgeo")`.

## Example

Load all __fgeo__ packages in one step.

```{r example}
library(fgeo)
```

Need help? Use `fgeo_help()` to search every help file in the __fgeo__ package.

```R
fgeo_help()
```

You can narrow down your search by using a keyword.

```R
fgeo_help("datasets")
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/YlgRljc.png)

```{r}
# Short name
stem <- luquillo_stem_1ha
# This dataset comes with multiple censuses.
unique(stem$CensusID)
stem
```

Pick one census from the bottom (n < 0) rank of `CensusID`. 

```{r}
stem6 <- pick_top(stem, var = CensusID, n = -1)
unique(stem6$CensusID)
```

Determine the status of each tree based on the status of each stem.

```{r}
stem6 <- add_status_tree(stem6, status_a = "A", status_d = "D")
alive_trees <- subset(stem6, status_tree == "A")

# Note that alive trees may have some missing, gone or dead stems
some_cols <- c( "treeID", "status_tree", "stemID", "status")
example_tree <- 46
subset(alive_trees, treeID == example_tree, some_cols)
```

Pick stems of 10 mm or more.

```{r}
ten_plus <- pick_dbh_min(alive_trees, 10)
range(ten_plus$dbh, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Count distinct values of `stemID` and `treeID`.

```{r}
# Drop missing values of `dbh`
non_missing <- filter(ten_plus, !is.na(dbh))

# Stem abundance
abundance(non_missing)

# Tree abundance (picking main stems -- with highest `hom` and largest `dbh`)
largest_stem <- fgeo.tool::pick_main_stem(non_missing)
abundance(largest_stem)
```

Count largest stems (unique `treeID`s) by species.

```{r}
by_sp <- group_by(largest_stem, sp)
abundance(by_sp)
```
