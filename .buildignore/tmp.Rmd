### Introduction

To help you analyze forest diversity and dynamics with ForestGEO data we developed [fgeo](https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo/). _[fgeo] is a collection of R packages that share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures, with the aim that learning one package makes it easier to learn the next. As well as being a collection of packages, [fgeo] itself is also a package. This provides a convenient way of downloading all [fgeo] packages with [`install.packages("fgeo")`]_, and of loading them with `library(fgeo)`. 

### Contents

This first release of fgeo conservatively provides only the [most obviously needed tools](https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo/articles/siteonly/reference.html), including functions to [access example datasets](https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo.x/index.html); to [pick specific rows](https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo.tool/reference/pick_main_stem) and [add useful columns](https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo.tool/reference/add_var); to [plot species distribution and topography](https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo.plot/reference/autoplot.sp_elev); to analyze [abundance and basal area](https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo.analyze/reference/abundance), [demography](https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo.analyze/reference/recruitment_ctfs), and [species-habitat association](https://forestgeo.github.io/fgeo.analyze/reference/tt_test).

### Related work

fgeo is inspired by two projects. The [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org) (the most popular, coherent ecosystem of R packages today) inspired fgeo's design. And the "[CTFS R Package](http://ctfs.si.edu/Public/CTFSRPackage/)" inspired many features. fgeo provides an intentionally small number features because it favors relevance over quantity. __fgeo__ will grow with your feedback. Please [let us know what to fix, enhance, and add](https://github.com/forestgeo/fgeo/issues/new).
