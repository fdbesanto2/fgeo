# Overview

This document produces two types of output:

1. .html: Good for websites; Themed consistently with other .html files of the __fgeo__ development.

2. .md: Good for GitHub -- but notice that the custom theme will be lost. 

An alternative format you may be interested 

If you don't want the .html file and instead you prefer an .md file
