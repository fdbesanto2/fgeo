EDIT: ADD BADGES CREATED WITH:

```R
use_lifecycle_badge("experimental")
use_cran_badge()
```

EDIT: CONSIDER ADDING BADGES CREATED WITH:

```
# In .travis.yml consider adding `warnings_are_errors: false`
use_travis()

use_coverage("coveralls")
```

The goal of __EDIT-PACKAGE-NAME__ is to ...



## Installation

```
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("EDIT-OWNER/EDIT-PACKAGE-NAME")
```

For details on how to install packages from GitHub, see [this article](https://goo.gl/dQKEeg).

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
## basic example code
```


## Code of Conduct

EDIT: Run this:

```
use_tidy_coc()

use_directory(".github")
# move coc manually to .github/
```

## EDIT: READ AND DELETE THIS SECTION

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
